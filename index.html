        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I was homeschooled all my life and have always and will always be glad I was. I first discovered my passion
        for learning certain things when I took chemistry in 9th grade, and have since been fascinated by a few other
            subjects including but not limited to: Computer science, Physics, Chemistry, Algebra, and Music.
        My computer science curriculum consisted of little bits here and there until I finished high school where
            I've been using Udemy online learning as my curriculum
        My Physics and Chemistry were both DVD series by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wes-olson-4b455b8">Wes Olsen.</a> </p>
